# UnrealMarchingSquares
Simple little project to implement marching squares in Unreal

After reading [Implementing Marching Squares](http://jacobzelko.com/marching-squares/) decided to use it as an opportunity to learn more Unreal. Things I wanted to learn in the process:

* Implement marching squares
* Generate static meshes at runtime
* Add materials to meshes at runtime 

Extra things I ended up learning:

* How to set a default camera and pawn
* How to parent Actors and Components
* Difference between meshes and mesh components

Fun to learn and quickly implment, thanks goes to Jacob Zelko for the great article that insipred me to do this.
